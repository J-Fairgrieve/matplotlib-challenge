# Matplotlib Challenge
### A homework assignment from the University of Birmingham Data Analytics Bootcamp (November 2021)

The aim of this project was to create a [series of summary tables and graphs](https://github.com/J-Fairgrieve/matplotlib-challenge/blob/main/pymaceuticals_starter.ipynb) using pandas and Matplotlib from a self combined dataset. Analysis includes:
 - Summary Statistics
 - Bar Plots
 - Pie Plots
 - Quartiles, IQR and Outliers
 - Box Plots
 - Line Plots
 - Scatter Plots
 - Correlation and Regression

## Observations
 - With a correlation coefficient of 0.84 it is clear that the heavier the mouse, the higher the volume of tumour it has.
 - Mice that undergo the Capomulin regimen have a lower average tumour volume, which could suggest that is the most effective drug. The effectiveness is displayed in the line graph with the tumour on subject l509 losing volume over time.
 - Out of all of the drugs displayed on the boxplot, only Infubinol has an outlier. The outlier shows a much smaller tumour volume than expected for that treatment.
